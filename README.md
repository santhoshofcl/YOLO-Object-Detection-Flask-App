# YOLO-Object-Detection-Flask-App
This project provides a web application that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection. The application captures live video from your webcam, processes the frames using YOLO, and displays the video stream with detected objects annotated with bounding boxes and labels.
